# MTG-Data-Parsing-and-Searching
Two programs will be created, one called parser.c that takes the .csv file and outputs a sorted index of entries to a binary file index.bin and the entries themselves to a separate binary file. The other program called search.c, will open the index file to binary search a desired card by name repeatedly until the user quits.
